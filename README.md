# whichtree
Tree suggestion system from CAD blocks, using Lunchbox Neural Network components and Grasshopper. The image files contain a presentation of how the algorithm works, while the .gh files contain the actual algorithm.

Also included is a Python Wikipedia scraping script that looks up Wikipedia pages for a large list of trees, and returns select properties (height, trunk diameter, location) into a CSV that is then used to train a Grasshopper Neural Network with Lunchbox.
